i have a dockerfile defining a node app on centos
and another container with mongo that is linked in
now i'm trying to figure out how to connect nginx into that..

So you want to have nginx i.e load balance between these tow?
You can have nginx as seprate container, nginx has docker image published on docker hub you can use that. 
Once you have exposed port nginx can connect to the docker container with hostname of docker
and if nginx is outside docker in that case you need to connect to those docker container with hostname 
where those containers are deployed and yes port has to published.
