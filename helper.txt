Things to be considered before using docker in production
https://medium.com/@OPTASY.com/should-i-use-docker-in-production-environment-is-it-safe-3c6f7907ca62
Created an AWS account as the first step. This is a free account, so my concern is about how much of the service I can use. I should get to know the boundaries of these services so that I can maintain under free tier service.

Doubts on docker
I have 2 containers www (for apache+php) and mysql. Everything works fine but after restart, mysql each time have new IP. Which is the right way to solve this problem?
are you linking your mysql container to your www container? If so, use "env" for your CMD so you can use the variable which holds the IP for your MYSQL container

Remote accessing a docker container

so how do you access different internal IPs, from outside of the container?

do i have to use a SOCKS proxy ... or DNS config? are those the only ways? (some kind of additional forwarding)
http://lalyos.github.io/blog/2013/10/06/access-docker-containers-via-internal-ip/
Can use ssh with socks proxy
you have to expose what you want on unique ports and use --ip-forward=true
or use nginx as your router
I prefer to use nginx as my router, gives me more control over what i expose and a clean place to get at the logs
you run nginx on the host system and set up proxyforward rules in itâ€™s config that forward things like 0.0.0.0:80/app1 to 172.17.0.2:8080 and 0.0.0.0:80/app2 to 172.17.0.3:8080
