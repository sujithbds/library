  Create a dockerfile as shown below, then the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d script
  Dockerfile

  FROM postgres:9.5

  RUN mkdir -p /tmp/psql_data/

  COPY db/structure.sql /tmp/psql_data/
  COPY scripts/init_docker_postgres.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
  
  
  #!/bin/bash

  DB_DUMP_LOCATION="/tmp/psql_data/structure.sql"

  echo "*** CREATING DATABASE ***"

  psql -U postgres < "$DB_DUMP_LOCATION";

  echo "*** DATABASE CREATED! ***"
  
  and then you can build your image as

  docker build -t abhije***/postgres-data .

  docker run -d abhije***/postgres-data

  Alternatively, you can just mount a volume to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ that contains all your DDL scripts.
  You can put in *.sh, *.sql, or *.sql.gz files and it will take care of executing those on start-up.

  e.g. (assuming you have your scripts in /tmp/my_scripts)
  docker run -v /tmp/my_scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d postgres
