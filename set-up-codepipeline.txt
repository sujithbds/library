How to set up codepipe line for your application?
Set up a repository in codecommit
 - push your application source code into the  repository. In your case, a simple lumen application code.
   Before that ensure that the required file types has been ignored in the git.
   Normally this includes your vendor folder or node_modules directories and the .env files where the environment variables 
   are configured which may include secret datas.
Here I have already created a repository, now I will pull the repository  and make some changes.   
   - I cloned the project to my system.
      - While cloning git asked for username and password.
       - So I logged into the aws console and navigate to iam user and generated a https access key for accessing 	the repository.
       - Then copied the repository url from the codecommit repositories and started cloning. You have to provide 
         the user credential to clone the repository.
   - Once the repository is cloned add the buildspec.yml file in the repository and commited and pushed into
   	 master.
