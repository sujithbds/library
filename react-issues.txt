I added the below line in webpack.prod.babel.js under performance options, now the warning is not coming. Don't know about the performance.

performance: {
    assetFilter: assetFilename =>
      !/(\.map$)|(^(main\.|favicon\.))/.test(assetFilename),
    hints: false,
    maxEntrypointSize: 512000,
    maxAssetSize: 512000  
 },
